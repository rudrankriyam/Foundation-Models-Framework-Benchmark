# Foundation Models Framework Benchmark

This repo measures Foundation Models performance across macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS using the Foundation Models framework.

## Requirements

- Xcode 26.0 or newer (SDKs for macOS 26, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, visionOS 26).
- Apple Intelligence enabled on the test device.

## Running the Benchmark

Open the project in Xcode and select the appropriate destination in the run destination picker.

Launch `FoundationStudio.app`, and ensure Apple Intelligence is available. Then tap **Run Benchmark**. Once complete, use the export buttons to save or share the report.
